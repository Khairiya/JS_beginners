# JS_beginners
This is a beginner friendly guide to learning Javascript.
It takes the learner through the basics and then helps use the knowledge in building projects
There are 6 challenges (projects) in all, including;
1. Your Age in Days
2. Image Generator
3. Rock, Paper, Scissors
4. Change the Color of all Buttons
5. Black Jack
6. Fetching Data from an API
To better understand the concepts of js and be able to use it to solve everyday problems, I recommend you try other projects as well.
Remember to learn at your own pace.
